# Computational-Dynamics-of-a-Spinning-Top
## Description
- This project provides numerical solutions to the equations of motion for a rotating rigid body, as described by Klein and Sommerfeld in *The Theory of the Top*. Visualizations of these solutions are provided, showcasing the system in phase space and a determination of the onset of chaotic motion by analyzing angular acceleration. Together, this analysis can be used to determine the onset of chaotic motion as a function of the intitial parameters of the system.
## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- matplotlib
